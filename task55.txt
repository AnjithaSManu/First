PYTHON WEB CGI-PROGRAMMING

The word CGI is the acronyms of the "Common Gateway Interface", which is used to define how to exchange information between the web server and a custom script. The NCSA officially manages the CGI scripts.The Common Gateway Interface is a standard for external gateway programs to interface with the server, such as HTTP Servers.
In simple words, it is the collection of methods used to set up a dynamic interaction between the server, and the client application. When a client sends a request to the webserver, the CGI programs execute that particular request and send back the result to the webserver.
	The users may submit the information in web browser by using HTML <form> or <isindex> element. There is a server's special directory called cgi-bin, where cgi script is generally stored. When a client makes a request, the server adds the additional information to request.Python provides the CGI module, which helps to debug the script and also support for the uploading files through a HTML form.

The given below is an example: 

#!/usr/bin/python
print("Content-type: text/html\n")
print("<html>")
print("<head>")
print("<title>Hello, CGI!</title>")
print("</head>")
print("<body>")
print("<h1>Hello, CGI!</h1>")
print("</body>")
print("</html>")
